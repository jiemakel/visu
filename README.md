VISU
====

Visual SPARQL query tool, available at http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/visu/. Combines [YASQE](http://yasqe.yasgui.org/) and [YASR](http://yasr.yasgui.org/) from [YASGUI](http://yasgui.org/) with the [Google Visualization API](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference), so that the results of SPARQL queries can be instantly visualized.

The tool is also able to save its state in the URL, so queries and visualizations can be shared. For example, [this query](http://goo.gl/QtDrzm) aggregates births and deaths by place and time in DBpedia, and visualizes the results as a motion chart. The chart shows for example that for some reason Wikipedia contains a disproportionate number of French people who died in the 1930s, while the number of Chinese people appearing is altogether very low.
